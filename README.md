# hello-world
First test repository.

Hello!

This is my first time using GitHub.
I am a Mathematics graduate working as a statistician working in the Civil Service. I previously worked in the Financial Service sector as a data analyst. 
This Git is where I store personal projects to build up a portfolio of work.
